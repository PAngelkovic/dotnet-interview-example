# IC .Net interview example
The topic of this coding example is a task list. When you download the repository, everything is already built so the application can display a list of tasks, also the application will already contain a set of tasks - those tasks are the ones you should work on during this coding example. They are about refactoring the existing code base, adding some extensions to it or only answering some questions.

## What should you do?
- Spend 2-3 hours working on the example
- Setup the solution as described in the "Setup" below
- Follow the "Guidelines" described below for your development
- The tasks you need to solve you find in the application itself as soon as you start and open it in your browser
- There are many tasks which in total will most probably take longer then 2-3 hours. So spend your time on the tasks which show us your skills best

## Guidelines
- Work in a public github repository so we can review your code
- Use best practices whenever you can
- Use gitflow and work on seperarte branches for each task
- Before submitting the code to us make sure you merged everything back to master branch cause this is the branch we will review

## Setup
- Download this repo to your machine
- Create a public github repo on your account
- Commit to code to your repo
- Open the solution at /src/IC.DotNet.Interview.sln in your Visual studio
- Restore nuget packages for the solution
- In the class IC.DotNet.Interview.Core.Database.DbContext edit the const field DATABASE_PATH to a path in the root of your repo eg. @"C:\Source\database.json" if your repository is placed at C:\Source.
- Start the application from visual studio
- You should see the task list for this example in your browser now
- Make sure the file database.json was created where you expected and is commited to your git repo

## Need help?
If you should have any problems during the setup or the work on the project don't hesitate to contact your contact for the interview
